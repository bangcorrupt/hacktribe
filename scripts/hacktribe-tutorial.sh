# Hacktribe firmware patch tutorial
#
# See https://github.com/bangcorrupt/hacktribe for details.

# This tutorial will help you learn how to run a few bash commands and a python script.
# For best results, read everything, 
# run each command separately and pay attention to the output.
#
# Anything starting with a '#' character is a comment and ignored by the shell 
# (you don't need to type these).  
# We can use comments to disable a command (see line 66 below).
#
# You will need to install git, python and pip.
#
# Happy hacking!


# First we need to download some files.  Clone the repo, including all submodules:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bangcorrupt/hacktribe.git

# Then change directory to the 'hacktribe' directory we just downloaded:
cd hacktribe

# Next we need to download the factory firmware.  
# This is proprietary and copyrighted.  
# Please only download it for yourself and do not distribute it.  
# 
# 'wget' command can be used to download files if we know the URL:
wget https://cdn.korg.com/us/support/download/files/0b87bcd3112fbb8c0ad7b0f55e618837.zip

# Unzip the zip archive we just downloaded to access the files inside:

 


# Move the firmware update file 'SYSTEM.VSB' to our current directory '.' :
mv electribe_sampler_system_v202/SYSTEM.VSB .

# Now we have all the files in the right places.

# Next, make sure the required python packages are installed:
pip install argparse bsdiff4

# Now we are ready to run the firmware patching script.
# This will apply the hacktribe patch to the factory firmware,
# then check the sha256 hash of the patched file.
# If the hashes match, you have the same file I tested.
# If not, you will get a scary error message saying 'patch failed' or something.
#
# If you're installing hacktribe to a factory synth (grey or blue) 
# for the first time, we need to modify the update file header as well.
# (If you already have a previous version of hacktribe installed, this is not necessary).
#
# EITHER: Run the firmware patching script for synth, using '-e' flag to modify header:
python scripts/e2-firmware-patch.py -e

# OR: Run the firmware patching script for sampler/hacktribe, no flags necessary:
# python scripts/e2-firmware-patch.py

# If the patching was successful, 
# you should see 'Firmware patched successfully' in the output from the script.  

# Copy 'hacked-SYSTEM.VSB' to the 'System' directory on the SD card, 
# rename it to 'SYSTEM.VSB' and run the firmware update function on the device.

# Everything is done nowm the rest is just tidying up.

# Move hacked-SYSTEM.VSB to parent directory:

# mv hacked-SYSTEM.VSB ..

# Change directory to parent directory:

# cd ..

# Delete all the files we downloaded:

# rm -rf hacktribe

# See https://github.com/bangcorrupt/hacktribe/discussions/41 if you are having difficulties
